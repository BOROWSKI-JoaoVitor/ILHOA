## **Description** 
ILHOA (InstantLy Have Overall Analysis) is a robust and automated pipeline designed to analyse crack healing in self-healing concrete materials. Composed of Fiji and Python codes, it takes microscopy images as input and returns ready-to-publish graphics and statistical analysis of the whole crack extension. It offers precise and scalable tools for data acquisition, processing, and visualization, aiming to enhance research workflows by replacing manual assessments with automated and reproducible methodologies. 

## **Recommended Implementation**
Instructions on the recommended environment setup, installation, and dependencies required to run ILHOA efficiently. This section will provide a step-by-step guide to getting started.

## **Important**
> ⚠️ **Please Note**: Before using ILHOA, ensure that all dependencies are correctly installed, and the data is pre-processed according to the guidelines provided in the [Recommended Implementation](#recommended-implementation) section. Incompatible versions or improperly formatted data may cause the pipeline to fail.

## **Example**
A practical example demonstrating how to use ILHOA, including sample data and commands. This section showcases the main features of the pipeline and explains typical use cases.

## **Description of This GitHub Repository**
An overview of the repository’s structure, with explanations of the key directories and files. This section clarifies where to find scripts, datasets, documentation, and other essential components of the project.

## **Additional Information**
The name Ilhoa came before the acronym. As a pipeline composed of Fiji (the name of an actual island) and Python (the name of a snake) codes, a Brazilian island populated solely by snakes was chosen to name this pipeline. Ilhoa is a snake island, located in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The highly venomous pit viper Golden Lancehead (Jararaca-ilhoa) is critically endangered. This name choice aims to raise awareness for brazilian endangered species

The name Ilhoa was selected prior to creating its acronym. As a pipeline integrating Fiji (named after a real island) and Python (named after a snake), it was inspired by a Brazilian island known for its unique snake population. Ilhoa is a reference to Snake Island, located in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, home to the critically endangered Jararaca-ilhoa, or Golden Lancehead pit viper. This name choice is intended to raise awareness of endangered Brazilian species, spotlighting the importance of conservation efforts.
