## **Description** 
ILHOA (InstantLy Have Overall Analysis) is a robust and automated pipeline designed to analyse crack healing in self-healing concrete materials. Composed of Fiji and Python codes, it takes microscopy images as input and returns ready-to-publish graphics and statistical analysis of the whole crack extension. It offers precise and scalable tools for data acquisition, processing, and visualization, aiming to enhance research workflows by replacing manual assessments with automated and reproducible methodologies. 

## **Recommended Implementation**
1- Install Fiji (ImageJ) and all necessary Macros 

2- Install [Python 3.8.16](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3816/) or [later versions](https://www.python.org/downloads/), and all necessary packages and their dependencies. All python code was run and tested with version 3.8.16

3- To run the Python code, we reccomend utilizing an IDE such as [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/?section=windows)

## **Important**
> ⚠️ **Please Note**: Before using ILHOA, ensure that all microscopy image files have the right format, and are correctly named according to the guidelines provided in the [Example](#example) section. Incompatible format or improperly formatted data may cause the pipeline to fail.

## **Example**
A practical example demonstrating how to use ILHOA, including sample data and commands. This section showcases the main features of the pipeline and explains typical use cases.

## **Description of This GitHub Repository**
An overview of the repository’s structure, with explanations of the key directories and files. This section clarifies where to find scripts, datasets, documentation, and other essential components of the project.

## **Additional Information**
The name Ilhoa was selected prior to creating its acronym. As a pipeline integrating Fiji (named after a real island) and Python (named after a snake), it was inspired by a Brazilian island known for its unique snake population. Ilhoa is located in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, home to the critically endangered Jararaca-ilhoa, or Golden Lancehead pit viper. This name choice is intended to raise awareness of endangered Brazilian species, spotlighting the importance of conservation efforts.
